# Electric Vehicles and Renewable Energy: A State-Level Analysis

## **Overview**

**Main Research Question**: *Electric vehicles reduce direct emissions, but does the electricity used to charge them actually come from clean sources?*

**Chosen Sub-Question**: *Are EV registrations concentrated in states with cleaner energy mixes? Specifically, do states with higher percentages of renewable energy in their total energy use show higher rates of EV adoption?*

This analysis explores the relationship between renewable energy usage and electric vehicle adoption across U.S. states in 2023. Understanding this relationship is crucial because EVs are only as "clean" as the electricity that powers them. If EVs are concentrated in states with coal-heavy energy grids, their environmental benefits are diminished.

## **Analysis**

### Key Findings

**1. Geographic Patterns in Renewable Energy**

The first map reveals significant geographic variation in renewable energy usage. Western states, particularly those in the Pacific Northwest and Mountain West, show the highest percentages of renewable energy. This is largely due to abundant hydroelectric power (Washington, Oregon, Idaho) and wind resources (Montana, Wyoming). In contrast, many Midwestern and Southern states remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels, showing lower renewable percentages.

**2. EV Adoption Concentration**

The second map demonstrates that EV adoption is extremely concentrated. California dominates with over 1.2 million EVs (requiring a log scale for visualization), followed by Florida, Texas, and Washington. This concentration reflects a combination of factors including state incentives, charging infrastructure, and population density rather than purely energy mix.

**3. Limited Correlation Between Clean Energy and EV Adoption**

The scatter plot reveals a **weak positive relationship** between renewable energy percentage and EV adoption. While some high-renewable states like Washington show high EV numbers, the relationship is not strong. California, despite having a moderate renewable percentage (~8%), has by far the most EVs due to aggressive policy support and population size.

**4. Progress in Renewable Energy (2021-2023)**

The change map shows that many states made progress in increasing their renewable energy share between 2021 and 2023, particularly in the Midwest and South. This suggests the energy grid is gradually becoming cleaner, which bodes well for the environmental impact of EVs.

### Implications for the Main Research Question

**Does the electricity used to charge EVs actually come from clean sources?**

The answer is **mixed and geography-dependent**:

- **Best case**: EV owners in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana are charging with 20-40% renewable electricity, making their vehicles significantly cleaner than gas cars.

- **Moderate case**: States like California, despite moderate renewable percentages, have strong EV adoption. These EVs are cleaner than gas cars but still rely substantially on natural gas.

- **Challenging case**: Many Southern and Midwestern states with coal-heavy grids have relatively few EVs, but those that exist are being charged with mostly fossil fuel electricity, reducing their environmental benefits.

### Recommendations

1. **Policy Alignment**: States should coordinate EV incentives with renewable energy investments to maximize environmental benefits.

2. **Grid Improvement**: As renewable energy infrastructure improves (as shown in the 2021-2023 change map), the existing EV fleet automatically becomes cleaner.

3. **Regional Strategies**: EV adoption strategies should account for regional energy mixesâ€”states with cleaner grids should receive priority for EV infrastructure investments to maximize emission reductions.

The maps clearly show that the environmental benefits of EV adoption are not uniform across the country and depend critically on the source of electricity in each state.
